# Palindrome-or-not
- Now, if you are too lazy to check whether a number is palindrome or not, this code will do it.
- I know there are many stuff to be improved, but i am limited to the standard stuff as for now.
- Will make it much efficient later!
- Made part of school project. Its a basic C++ code.
